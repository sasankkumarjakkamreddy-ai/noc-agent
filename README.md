# ⚡ NOC Agent — Explainable Agentic Incident Response

An autonomous network operations system that diagnoses BGP incidents, generates remediation plans, and **pauses for human approval** before touching production. Every decision is logged, explainable, and auditable.

Built with **Claude (Anthropic) + LangGraph + FastAPI + React**.

## The Problem

71% of IT leaders don't trust AI to make autonomous network changes. The blocker isn't accuracy — it's **auditability**. Most AI tools give you an answer but not the reasoning behind it.

This system shows its work at every step.

---

## How It Works

```
Syslog Alert → OBSERVE → HYPOTHESIZE (Claude) → REMEDIATE (Claude) → HUMAN APPROVAL → Audit Log
```

| Step | What Happens |
|------|-------------|
| 🔍 **OBSERVE** | Parses raw syslog, extracts key signals (interface, peer IP, timestamps) |
| 🧠 **HYPOTHESIZE** | Claude reasons like an L3 engineer — root cause, evidence, confidence % |
| 🔧 **REMEDIATE** | Generates exact IOS XR fix commands + rollback plan, rates risk level |
| ⚠️ **HUMAN APPROVAL** | Blocks execution until a human approves — high-risk changes never auto-execute |
| 📋 **AUDIT TRAIL** | Every incident, hypothesis, action, and approval logged to SQLite |

### Demo Scenario

**Incident:** BGP session down on `core-router-zurich-01`

**Claude's diagnosis:**
- Root cause: MTU mismatch (local=1500, peer=9000)
- Cause: Automated agent changed interface MTU 2 hours prior
- Confidence: 92%
- Risk: MEDIUM → human approval required

**Generated fix commands:**
```
configure terminal
interface TenGigE0/0/0/0
mtu 9000
commit
end
clear bgp ipv4 unicast * soft
```

**Rollback commands ready** if the fix fails.
